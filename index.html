# Kichwata yachakushun
## Aprendamos Kichwa
## Let's learn Kichwa

This project aims to promote the Kichwa language and culture by offering free resources available on the internet that people can find and learn in a self-taught way. Compiling texts, videos, and other relevant materials favors the student because all the material can be found in one place.

### Bibliography
Here are the works that have inspired this project. I take them as a starting point that will grow as my research and knowledge of the digital humanities grows. In this selection the public will be able to find a variety of works. From tutorials describing the steps to use HTML, CCS, essays on Digital Humanities, Ideologies of language to Kichwa teaching books.

#### About Course-in-a-Box

P2PU created Course-in-a-Box in 2014 as a free and lightweight tool for building online courses. We wanted to preserve the modular structure of MOOCs outside of the bulky (and often proprietary) environment of learning/content management systems. Course-in-a-Box is open-source, and we welcome contributions [on our Github repo](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box).

p.s. Designing a course for learning circles? [Check out the Learning Circle Course Creation guide](https://docs.p2pu.org/courses/creating-courses) for some best practices on course design.
