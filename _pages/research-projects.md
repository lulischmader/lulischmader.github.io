    <p>I recently was awarded the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship from the US Department of Education to learn the Kichwa language in the Ecuadorian Amazon this Summer of 2023. The program offers 140 contact hours of intensive instruction over six weeks.</p>

    <h2>Project 2: Rights of Nature</h2>
    <p>Map of the Indigenous territorios of Ecuador.</p>
    <p>My second line of investigation takes place in the Ecuadorian Amazon. I am drawing from the ancestral knowledge and Indigenous cosmovision of the "Sumak Kawsay" (Good living) and "Sacha Kawsay" (Living Forest) along with the Rights of Nature that are protected under the Constitution of Ecuador. I analyze the interaction between individuals, Indigenous communities, and the government to reach a consensus that looks after the well-being of local and national ecosystems. Countries such as Ecuador and Bolivia have integrated legislation in favor of Nature. These innovative ways of living in harmony with the environment can also be applied in the global context to reverse the accelerated destruction of Nature.</p>
