    # Project 1: The Kichwa Project
    I recently was awarded the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship from the US Department of Education to learn the Kichwa language in the Ecuadorian  Amazon this Summer of 2023. The program offers 140 contact hours of intensive instruction over six weeks. I will be sharing my experiences on this journey in the Fall 2023.
