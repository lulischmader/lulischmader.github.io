>I recently was awarded the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship from the US Department of Education to learn the Kichwa language in the Ecuadorian Amazon this Summer of 2023. The program offers 140 contact hours of intensive instruction over six weeks.

I analyze the interaction between individuals, Indigenous communities, and the government to reach a consensus that looks after the well-being of local and national ecosystems.

These innovative ways of living in harmony with the environment can also be applied in the global context to reverse the accelerated destruction of Nature.
